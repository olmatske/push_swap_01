Checklist

- [X] Error checking
- [X] No dupes!!!
- [X] put everything in tokens
- [X] put tokens in stack_a
- [X] write all the helper functions (like sa, ra etc pp)

	Do nothing if there is only one element or none.
	- [X] sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.
	- [X] sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.
	- [X] ss : sa and sb at the same time.

	Do nothing if a/b is empty.
	- [X] pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
	- [X] pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.

	The first element becomes the last one.
	- [X] ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.
	- [X] rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1.
	- [X] rr : ra and rb at the same time.
	The last element becomes the first one.
	- [X] rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.
	- [X] rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1.
	- [X] rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.

- [X] decide on alrogrithm
- [X] write indexer
- [ ] write algorithm logic
	- [X] bitwise operation functions
	- [X] write radix logic
- [X] write tiny sort ( for 3 and 5 numbers)
- [X] is sorted function
	> is value > next->value


- [X] ft_free
- [X] only 1 number??
- [X] double number doesn't work if it has a 0 before it
- [ ] are rra and ra right?
- [ ] fsanitize flags remove and check leaks
- [ ] ft_printf fix in wrapper
- [ ] fix input ./push_swap "2147483647 843 56544 24394 -> not finished string should give an error
- [ ] write main
- [ ] test against a push_swap checker (random 10/100/500 cases, leaks, edge cases like already sorted, reverse sorted, duplicates rejected before)
